Enthusiastic, curious, user-focused. My physics education and 6+ years of software development experience allows me to always keep the big picture in mind. It also gives me a wide variety of tools to design the best solution.

Having a good grasp of who will use the product and to what end is the most important thing both in software and game development.

Reasons to work with me:
* Generalist mindset: I focus on the big picture and use the right tool for the right job.
* Quick iterations: We will hold regular product demo and design clarification meetings.
* Attention to user interaction: I not only strive to deliver a functioning product, I also take care that it will be pleasant (and fun) to use.
